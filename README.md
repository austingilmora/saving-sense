   This is an awesome app that helps people record their transactions wherever they are in the world. This app now has offline capabilities with IndexedDB and a service-worker, so it can even be used when you have less than optimal connection.

## Installation
  To download my app, all you have to do is grab the necessary files from my repository and run 'npm install'. Then you have all you need to continue adding functionality to this app. Otherwise, this app can be viewed at https://dry-gorge-57166.herokuapp.com/
  
## Usage
  To use this app, all you need to do is go into the file with Git Bash and run 'npm start' to start the server, then you can test the functionality locally.
If you want to experience the deployed app, it is deployed at https://dry-gorge-57166.herokuapp.com/ . After you open it up for the first time, if you lose connection, it can still be viewed using the cached files and you can still add or subtract funds that will be displayed locally until they can be fired off to the database when connection is restored.
